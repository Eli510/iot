# Infectious Disease

* Mathematical models can project how infectious diseases progress to show the likely outcome of an epidemic and help inform public health interventions
* Models use some basic assumptions and mathematics to find parameters for various infectious diseases and use those parameters to calculate the effects of different interventions such as mass vaccination programs
* Trained as a physician, Daniel Bernoulli 1700â€”1782 created a mathematical model to defend the practice of inoculating against smallpox in 1766
* A simple epidemic models describes the relationship between susceptible, infected, and immune individuals in a population, P = (R<sup>N</sup>-1)/2
* The basic reproduction number R of an infection is the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all P individuals are susceptible to infection, and the serial interval S is the time between successive cases in a chain of N = log<sub>R</sub>(2P+1) generations to infect the entire population
* For the US population P = 333 938 907 , R = 3, S = 4 days
