* [LightBlue Cloud Connect](https://punchthrough.com/introducing-cloud-connect-for-lightblue-explorer/)
  * This feature allows you to listen for BLE notifications or indications and send this stream of data to the cloud platform of your choice.
  * Supported platforms are [AWS](https://punchthrough.com/setting-up-aws-iot-with-lightblue-cloud-connect/) and [Adafruit IO](https://punchthrough.com/setting-up-adafruit-io-with-lightblue-cloud-connect/).
  * You'll be prompted for your platform API credentials if your enable the feature.
